# 3D-Graphics-Project
How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

  This has been my first major project with computer graphics and design. The entire process has been vary interesting throughout. I was able to develop an eye for shapes along with noticing spacial differences. I did take the hard approach with this project through trial and error. I compiled and recompiled my code hundreds of times in order to find out the best design for my 3D-model. To be honest I am not entirely happy with it still. I do like the way I approached the project. However in the future, I may decide to change my approach and focus more on the mathmatical side of design.

How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

  I didn't really apply any new developmental strategies while working on this scene. I just figured out what worked and plowed forward with that. That is where iteration was so instramental in my development. I must have gone through 5-6 different environments of my own before settling back on the one that was provided for us. Taht being said, I am not giving up on my own development. It is just that the environment provided allowed for me to work on the milestones and focus only on developing my scene. 
  
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

As my end goal is to be a software engineer, computer graphics and visualization are an imperative part of my continued education and professon.
